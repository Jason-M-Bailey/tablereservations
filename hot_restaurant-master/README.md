# HOT RESTAURANT

* Description: Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery.
Our app is made up of two parts: 
1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.


Our Restaurant has just 5 tables available since it's amazingly popular. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.
